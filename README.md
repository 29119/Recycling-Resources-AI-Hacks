# Recycling-Resources-AI-Hacks
This is an AI chatbot that teaches people how to properly dispose of household hazardous waste/e-waste. 
I made this with Sandra Tang, Samantha Rivera, and Cammie Wei in one weekend at AI Hacks, the first hackathon in southern California for high school girls.
This was made using the app-development software Atom, and the collaborating tool Teletype.
Check out the finished app on this website: https://sandratang.github.io/recycle-app.html
